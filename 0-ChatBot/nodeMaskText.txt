we occupy the collective chimera
we are offered and become characters , not marionettes, in the ongoing drama inadequately called Big Data',

who are you
where are you
what are you
we are the mask on the nodes
we are the mask on your bikes

humans and machines together as beings that repeat

playing the paranodes
