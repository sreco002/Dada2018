You are the mask on a paranode
You are any puppet, exist in the bodies
You are offered and become characters , not marionettes, in the ongoing drama inadequately called Big Data',
You are any puppet, exist in the bodies
You are the network in node
You are on the nodes
You are any puppet, exist in the proof.
You are any puppet, exist in the frame.
You are you
You are the mask on your face
